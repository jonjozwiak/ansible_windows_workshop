= Workshop Lab Setup

image::tower.002.png['Tower']

== Setup

[IMPORTANT]
- Today's workshop infrastructure is being run in Amazon EC2.

- Each student will have four instances to use.  Connectivity details will be provided by the instructor.

- Central Active Directory, DNS, and GitLab environments are available for use.

== Workshop Infrastructure

Each student's personal EC2 lab is equipped with the following:

* (1) Control node (Linux host to run ansible plays and install Ansible Tower).
** Red Hat Enterprise 7.4
* (1) Windows Workstation (to interact with the environment, edit code, etc).
** Windows 2016
* (2) Windows Endpoint nodes (to execute ansible playbooks upon).
** Windows 2016
* Ansible Engine 2.4
* Ansible Tower 3.2

.Setup Your Environment

Before we can begin doing super-cool automations and such, we've got to get a few basics out of the way.
Namely... RDP and SSH access to your EC2 nodes.

== Testing your environment

Log into your workstation instance with an RDP client using the details provided by your instructor.  You will see a few things pre-installed for use today:

* Putty (SSH to the Ansible Linux host)
* Visual Studio Code (Editor for creating playbooks)
* Git (Source Code Control)
* Firefox

=== Tower

From your workstation, open up a putty window and connect to 's#tower' where # is your student number.  The user will be 'student#', and your password will be provided by the instructor.

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to your tower and workstation instances.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!  We will test access to the other hosts in the first exercise.

== End Result

At this point, everyone should have logged into your tower and workstation nodes.  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.
